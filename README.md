# IMPORTANT!
The Bonus Part is not perfect now, only half scores. I already find the problem and will try to fix it (see the Notes in BONUS PART), but I don't want to retry it, maybe in the future.

# Mandatory Part
## Notes
1.Remember to check the return vaule of write everytime you call the write function. If write fail, always return (-1);

2.For %s, if the input string is empty, write (null) derictly, and remember check the return value of write.

3.Check NULL input

4.For %p, when nb < base, also need to use "nb % 16" as the index for Hex string. This is differ to convert base for normal number.
